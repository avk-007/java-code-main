ability to a fuction to take on multiple forms

eg multyiple forms of methods of same name function
add(int a,int b) ,add(double a,double b),add(int a,int b,int c) etc

runtime polymoprph --static/earlt binding ==method overloading

/*method overloading in java rewffered as compile time poly. or early binding bcz the decison of which
method to call happens at compile time based on method signatuire method paramaters before the program executed*/


compile polymoprph==dynamic/late binding  ==method overriding

** methods be overloaded ways
1.method name should be same but different paramters
2.method name should be same but different data types
3.method name same,data types of parameters are same but the order pararmerts is different


if methods have diff return type then are methods are oveerloaded??
no,compile error

public class hello{

    public int add (int a ,int b){
        return a+b;
    }
    public double add (int  a ,int  b){
        return a+b;
    }

    //compile errors

}


----------------------------------

method overriding-in java allows a subclass to provide a specific implemenation of a method that is alrady
defined in its superclass
